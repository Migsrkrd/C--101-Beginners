## C# 101

## IMPORTANT

This repository is a collection of C# programs that I have written while learning C#. Before you start, I would like to tell you that I am not an expert in C#. `I am still learning C# and I am sharing my learning journey with you`. If you find any mistakes in my code, please let me know. I would be happy to learn from you.

Also, please follow these instruction if you are new to C# and are learning on VS Code:

1. Install the C# extension for Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the .NET SDK. You can download the .NET SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

If you are a visual learner and would like to check out some of the videos I used to learn C#, you can check out the following links:
